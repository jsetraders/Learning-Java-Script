	<h2>The JavaScript Syntax</h2>
	<p>The JavaScript Syntax is how the Java instructions are put together.</p>

	<script>
		//syntax for creating a js variable is as follows:
		var x; //this is the variable x
		let y; //this is for creating a block variable

		//using the variables as follows:
		a = 5;
		b = 6;
		let c = a + b; // let keyword creates also variables with values
	</script>


	<h3>#1 JavaScript Values</h3>
	<p>The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:<br>
		&#x2022; Fixed values, which are called <b>Literals</b>. <br>
		&#x2022; Variable values, which are called <b>Variables</b>. <br>
	</p>
	

	<h3>#2 JavaScript Literals</h3>
	<p>The two most important syntax rules for fixed values are:<br>
		1. <b>Numbers</b> are written with or without decimals:<br>
		&#x2022; 10.50<br> 
		&#x2022; 1001<br> 
		2. <b>Strings</b> are text, written within double or single quotes. <br>
		&#x2022; "John Doe"<br> 
		&#x2022; 'John Doe'<br> 
	</p>

	<h3>#3 JavaScript Variables</h3>
	<p><b>Variables</b> are used to <b>store</b> data values. In JavaScript <u>var</u>, <u>let</u>, <u>const</u> are use to <b>declare</b> variables.<br>
	<p><b>Equal signs</b> are used to <b>assign values</b> to variables.<br>
	In the below example, x is defined as a variable. Then, x is assigned(given) the value of 6:<br></p>
		
		<p id="demo_1"></p>	
		<script>
		let x;
		x = 6;
		document.getElementById("demo_1").innerHTML = x;

		/*Identifiers are used to name variables and keywords, and functions.

		The rules for legal names are the same in most programming languages.

		A JavaScript name must begin with:

		 - A letter (A-Z or a-z)
		 - A dollar sign ($)
		 - Or an underscore (_)

		Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs. */
