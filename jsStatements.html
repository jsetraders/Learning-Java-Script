	<h2>JavaScript Statements</h2>

		<h3>The JavaScript Program</h3>
			<p>The <b>JavaScript program</b> is a list of "instructions" to be executed by a computer. These programming instructions are called <b>statements</b>. These statements are normally between js scrpit tags or using certain methods</p>

			<p>In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser.</p>

			<p>JavaScript statements are composed of Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments. The follwoing statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with id="demo":</p>

			<p>First we need to locate a container. Lets use the HTML p tag and it's id attribute as follows:<br>
			"p id="dolly"/p" </p>

			<p>Then between js script tages place the following: <br>"document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly."; </p>

			<h4>The output will be:</h4>
			 <p id="dolly"></p> <!-- the container-->
				<script>//js exection part
			document.getElementById("dolly").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly."; </script> 

			<p>JavaScript statements or code, are executed one by ons in the order they are written. Semicolons(;) are used to separate JS statements.</p>

			<br>

		<h3>JavaScript Keywords</h3>
			<p>JavaScript statements often start with a <b>keyword</b> to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.<br>
			Our <u>Reserved Words Reference</u> lists all JavaScript keywords.<br>
			Here is a list of some of the keywords you will learn about in this tutorial:<br>
			JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.<br>

			<b>if:</b>	Marks a block of statements to be executed on a condition<br>
